  I'm a San Francisco Bay Area based data scientist who is all about scrutinizing data in pursuit of the big picture. I am currently a candidate for a Master of Science in Analytics, an interdisciplinary data science program, at Georgia Institute of Technology. My portfolio shows a selected group of projects with a wide range of processes including feature engineering, machine learning, predictive/statistical modeling, and data visualization.
