### Using SIR Models to Simulate an Epidenic: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach
<img src="images/flu_sim_thumbnail.png?raw=true"/>
This project uses an agent-based approach to the suseptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model. This stochastic model is used to simulate the spread of a flu virus in a classroom of 21 students. The effect of infection probability, length of the infectious period, and sample size on the epidemic outcomes are all explored and visualized.
