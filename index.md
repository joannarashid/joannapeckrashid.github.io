This project used varous machine learning models to identify relationships between spatial and temporal CO2 emissions and socioeconomic data. This project includes extensive feature engineering and complex spatial joins. Modeling methods include linear regression, random forest, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and K-means. Data visualization is deployed as a web-based interactive application that allows users to manipulate cluster assignments and selected data fields.

### Simulation: S-I-R, Agent-Based, Modeling to Simulate an Epidenic
<img src="images/flu_sim1.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/flu_sim2.png?raw=true"/>
Suseptible-infected-recovered (S-I-R), agent-based simulation is used to model a flu edpidemic. This stochastic model is used to simulate the spread of a flu virus in a classroom of 21 students. The effect of infection probability, length of the infectious period, and sample size on the epidemic outcomes are all explored and visualized.
